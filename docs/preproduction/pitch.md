# The Pitch

After you have developed a clear vision for your game you might be ready to pitch it to someone. If you haven't figured out what your game is about and what playing it is like yet you might want to check out [the vision document page](https://charlie.games/gamedev-workflow-docs/the-vision-document) first.

## I. What's a pitch?
The pitch for your game should be brief, concise, and engaging. Its goal is to get the listeners to be excited and invested in your project in a few short minutes. It should convince its audience that your game is worth making and that you/your team is capable of making it. It should answer the question of why somebody would buy this game instead of another one that already exists.

## II. Consider who you might be pitching to

If you are writing a pitch for a school class vs. a developer you want to work with vs. an investor or major publisher this might affect your presentation strategy. Think about who you're pitching to and what they'll most want to know. 

The following guide is mostly written with the audience of a publisher or investor in mind.

## III. Do some market research

It's important to know if there are people out there that even want to play your game. Depending on what your research reveals, you might realize that you want to make some key changes to your game to meet the demand of players. You want to have the answers to key questions about the market and make any game-changing decisions before you even start writing your pitch.

- Are there any games like yours that already exist?
- How many other games in your style/genre are out there? Is now a good time to be making a 2D platformer? (not really)
- What does your publisher usually publish/what genre are they most interested in?

## IV. How to format a pitch

A pitch should be in a visual format that is easy to follow such as a slide deck, single page PDF, or a video.

## V. What to put in your pitch

1. **Pictures! Gifs! Video!** - [here's a guide](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MattMirrorfish/20160105/263028/Promoting_Your_Game_With_Animated_GIFs.php) to making great gifs by Matt Mirrorfish
2. **A unique 1-2 sentence hook** - you should definitely read the section on hooks in [Victoria Tran's guide](https://medium.com/kitfox-games/the-0-marketing-game-guide-e649a5ac83f4) to games marketing. Your hook should clearly state what makes your game different/unique and explain what the player does.
3. **Describe the moment to moment gameplay** - your hook should have already introduced the core gameplay, but make sure that your whole pitch fully covers what the player is doing where the fun/interesting part is
4. **One or two high quality art images** - to sell the art style of your game

## VI. What **not** to put in your pitch

1. **Your game's detailed narrative backstory** - this isn't going to help sell it and it takes a long time to explain a ton of lore
2. **Mechanics that are not core to gameplay** - focus instead on what is defining and unique about your game. The audience can usually assume that your game has some sort of inventory management system if it's an RPG. No need to go into detail.
3. **Don't use realism to explain your design decisions** - unless it's a serious simulation game or realism is a core element
4. 

## VII. What to sometimes put in your pitch
1. **A [frame story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_story) to justify what is happening** - you don't need to justify that your player is answering gameshow questions on a game show. Only use a frame story if the reasoning for the gameplay is not obvious
2. **Address development risks** - if your game has them, otherwise not addressing them is a red flag
3. **A prototype** - a prototype should prove the concept feasibility of the parts of your game that arent obvious to imagine or easy to make

## Also consider:
- It should be obvious what is and isn't placeholder in your game
- Does your gameplay/concept match the platform?
